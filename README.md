#MathX Integration Instructions


MathX is a jQuery plugin and will be dependant on the jQuery library.  Make sure that your platform accepts jQuery and no other JavaScript libraries conflict with it.

To begin, include the necessary css and js files in the `head` of your website:

```
<link href='http://mathx.co/gotit/mathx/css/mathx.css' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
```
